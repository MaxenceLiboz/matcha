# Objective

The objective is to fill the database with 500 Users when we launch the database container.

# mysql.connector

## Utility

Create a connection with our database in our script, so we can launch mysql commands.

# Faker Library

## Utility

We're gonna use the Faker library in python in order to create 500 Users in our python script.

## Version 

Quote of the official documentation of Faker Library : *"Starting from version 4.0.0, Faker dropped support for Python 2 and from version 5.0.0 only supports Python 3.8 and above"*

So, we're need to use python 3.8 or above to launch the script properly (in our case we'll use python 3.9).
